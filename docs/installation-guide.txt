Gitmoji Notes (List of emojis: https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908 AND gitmoji specifications: https://gitmoji.dev/):

Disadvantages/limitations:
* Configuration is highly suggested to be done with .js instead of .json in order to properly manage templates, which can be additional complexity.
* We cannot use emojis on the commit descriptions because the changelog wont show them correctly, also if we do use commit descriptions we might break the template because of the line break that it includes, there is no problem with long commit subjects as long as they dont have line breaks, it seems to be okay to do 1 line break, so if we do more than 1 line break git will automatically interpret that as a commit description so as long as we dont want to see that on the release notes or changelog it should be fine.

Pending:
* How to make the other changes section (not matching any of the emojis defined)
* How can we make if equals something else logic checking object values in handlebars template and also format dates??


Solved:
* it can update the poms normally, with the semantic-release/exec plugin
* Use of none in the config: the emojis that are in here wont be taken in count for any version update, this is a little bit nonesense for now because if you dont want a emoji to trigger nothing, just dont list it.
* Pre-release works
* The changelog generation works the same way than with conventional commits.
* you can get the author name and email with: {{this.author.name}} and {{this.author.email}}
* Context variables (like commit attributes): https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/developer-guide/js-api.md

Notes:
* 4.0.0 is my best working config
