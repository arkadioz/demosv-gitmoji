Gitmoji Notes:

* Can not generate changelog
* Configuration is highly suggested to be done with .js instead of .json in order to properly manage templates, which can be additional complexity

Pending:

* Check if there is a way to include author on commits (release notes), maybe with substitutions like in the maven changelog plugin
* How to make the other changes section (not matching any of the emojis defined)

Solved:

* Use of none in the config: the emojis that are in here wont be taken in count for any version update, this is a little bit nonesense for now because if you dont want a emoji to trigger nothing, just dont list it
