Gitmoji Notes (List of emojis: https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908 AND gitmoji specifications: https://gitmoji.dev/):

Disadvantages/limitations:
* Configuration is highly suggested to be done with .js instead of .json in order to properly manage templates, which can be additional complexity.
* We cannot use emojis on the commit descriptions, also if we do use commit descriptions we might break the template because of the line break.

Pending:
* Check if there is a way to include author on commits (release notes), maybe with substitutions like in the maven changelog plugin
* How to make the other changes section (not matching any of the emojis defined)
* How can we make if equals something else logic checking object values in handlebars template and also format dates??


Solved:
* it can update the poms normally, with the semantic-release/exec plugin
* Use of none in the config: the emojis that are in here wont be taken in count for any version update, this is a little bit nonesense for now because if you dont want a emoji to trigger nothing, just dont list it.
* Prerelease works
* The changelog generation works the same way than with conventional commits.
* you can get the author name and email with: {{this.author.name}} and {{this.author.email}}

Notes:
* 4.0.0 is my best working config
