Gitmoji Notes:

* Can not generate changelog
* Configuration is highly suggested to be done with .js instead of .json in order to properly manage templates, which can be additional complexity

Pending:

* Check if there is a way to include author on commits (release notes), maybe with substitutions like in the maven changelog plugin
* How to make the other changes section (not matching any of the emojis defined)

Solved:

* Use of none in the config: the emojis that are in here wont be taken in count for any version update, and according to the documentation ignored is used to not be taken in count and also not included in the release-notes.
