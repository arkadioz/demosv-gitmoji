Gitmoji Notes:

* Can not generate changelog
* Configuration is highly suggested to be done with .js instead of .json in order to properly manage templates, which can be additional complexity

Pending:

* Check if there is a way to include author on commits (release notes), maybe with substitutions like in the maven changelog plugin
* Check what is the true use of ignored and none in the config
